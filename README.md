# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
Hello, I'm Igor, and I'm love software development and creating cool stuff lol.

# About Me
👨‍💻 I'm a junior programmer with a passion for coding and a curiosity for new challenges.

🎮 I enjoy game development, especially on retro gaming consoles. There's something about the low-level aspects of classic games that keeps me addicted.
